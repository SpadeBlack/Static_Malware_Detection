# Static_Malware_Detection
Overview-
This project is a Automated model for static Malware detection.
In the battle between speed & efficiency, it gives importance to speed with good effeciency.
It works as a precaution which can be used by user for security against malware infested executable files.
Demonstration-
Testing on .exe files
